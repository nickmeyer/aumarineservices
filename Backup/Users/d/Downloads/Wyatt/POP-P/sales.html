            <p>Dear Investor,</p>
            <p>My name is Andy Crowder and I am a former &ldquo;quant&rdquo; trader at Oppenheimer &amp; Co on Wall Street&hellip;</p>
            <p><strong>I have smuggled out a black-box technology used by some of the largest institutions in the world that predicts trades with a 90% mathematical accuracy.</strong></p>
            <p>My intention with posting this open letter online today is to get this tool into as many hands as possible before this page gets shut down. </p>
            <p>Now, you may be wondering why I would do something like this rather than just keeping it to myself and making millions of dollars.</p>
            <p>That&rsquo;s a good question and I WILL answer it&hellip;.</p>
            <p>But first, it&rsquo;s imperative that I explain what this tool is, why it works, and how you can use it to make yourself rich because we don&rsquo;t have much time (Remember -- this page could get shut down at any time).</p>

            <p class="h4 mt-5 mb-3 text-red text-center"><strong>19,106.10% Gains In 12 Months&hellip;</strong></p>

            <p>Please look very closely at this spreadsheet:</p>

            <figure class="float-lg-right mx-auto ml-lg-5 mb-4" style="max-width: 180px;">
                <img class="img-fluid" alt=""
                    src="https://img.bfpublishing.com/marketing/2019/fmmt/bloodbath-promo/sp/charts/gains-list.png">
            </figure>

            <p>What you see on the LEFT are 69 trades&hellip;</p>
            <p>Out of those 69 trades 8 resulted in a loss.</p>
            <p>That means, out of all these trades taken in 2018, <strong>88.41% </strong><strong>of them resulted in a gain</strong>. </p>
            <p>Now, on the RIGHT column, you see I started with $500.</p>
            <p>By simply rolling over the gains from the last trade into the next trade, I ended up with <strong>$96,030.50.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>To most individual investors these gains &ndash; and this win-rate &ndash; seem impossible.</strong></p>
            <p>Yet, these are REAL trades I took and they were all &lsquo;signaled&rsquo; to me by a computer algorithm developed by 3 genius mathematicians&hellip;</p>
            <p>This algorithm crunches mountains of data at super speed, analyzing hundreds of thousands of complex pieces of information harvested from hundreds of thousands of resources&hellip;</p>
            <p>And &ldquo;spits out&rdquo; a trade.</p>
            <p>As you can see, in the year 2018, this algorithm secretly referred to as the &ldquo;POP-P Indicator&rdquo; resulted in a near 90% win rate using the formula below:</p>

            <figure class="my-4" style="max-width: 420px;">
                <img class="img-fluid" alt="Equation"
                    src="assets/img/popp-v1/equation-img.png">
            </figure>

            <p>If that looks like hieroglyphics &ndash; don&rsquo;t worry about it. </p>
            <p>All you need to know is that this equation is what the advanced quantitative algorithm &ldquo;POP-P&rdquo; uses to pick trades with a 90% probability of winning.</p>

            <p class="h4 mt-5 mb-3 text-red text-center"><strong>This Is Why Normal Investors Get Fleeced And Most Traders Lose&hellip;</strong></p>

            <p>Quantitative algorithmic programs run by supercomputers and overseen by geniuses in mathematics, physics, computer science and more&hellip;</p>
            <p>&hellip; who were hired right at graduation from schools like MIT and handed $1 million (plus) entry level compensation packages by Institutional funds (like Oppenheimer)&hellip;</p>
            <p>&hellip;is what you are up against in the markets. </p>
            <p>Gone are the days of the square-jawed, broad-shouldered, testosterone-fueled Wall Street &ldquo;Finance Guy.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>They have been replaced with pasty, skinny, socially-awkward tech kids whose job is to program ultra-sophisticated trading robots, then sit back and watch them make millions upon millions of dollars. </p>
            <p>These computers are so intelligent and so fast they make split nano-second decisions based on news all over the world.</p>
            <p>For example, in 2013 the AP news agency in Washington published a tweet, &ldquo;Breaking: Two Explosions in White House and Barack Obama is injured.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Of course this wasn&rsquo;t true &ndash; the account had been hacked by a group calling themselves &ldquo;The Syrian Electronic Army.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Yet within milliseconds, quantitative algorithmic programs on Wall Street scanning the Internet for words or phrases that might effect stock markets captured&hellip;</p>
            <p><strong>&ldquo;</strong><strong>Obama</strong><strong>&rdquo;&hellip;&rdquo;</strong><strong>explosions</strong><strong>&rdquo;&hellip;.</strong>and<strong> &ldquo;</strong><strong>white house</strong><strong>&rdquo;</strong> then
                unleashed a torrent of trades. </p>
            <p>Within seconds, the Dow Jones had plunged 140 points and more than $200 billion of capital had been wiped out. </p>
            <p><strong>That&rsquo;s your </strong><strong><em>SAVINGS </em></strong><strong>these robots are playing with!</strong></p>
            <p>That&rsquo;s your livelihood left up to unfeeling, un-thinking, lightning-fast computer programs.</p>
            <p>They don&rsquo;t care if the news was right or wrong, or fake or real&hellip;</p>
            <p>Their job is to react and scalp the market millions of times a day, making money hand over fist. </p>
            <p>And their favorite instruments to trade on are the EXACT ETFs you&rsquo;re told are the &ldquo;safe diversified investment choices&rdquo; for your life-savings!</p>
            <p>That&rsquo;s GREAT for the Wall Street institutions like&hellip;</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Insurance companies</li>
                <li>Pension Funds</li>
                <li>Hedge Funds</li>
                <li>Mutual Funds</li>
                <li>University Endowments</li>
                <li>Private Equity Funds</li>
                <li>Banks</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&hellip;who are spending tens of millions to hundreds of millions of dollars a year developing these &ldquo;blackbox&rdquo; technologies.</p>
            <p>It&rsquo;s TERRIBLE for people like you&hellip;</p>
            <p>Because you probably don&rsquo;t have the money to hire your own team of &ldquo;quants&rdquo; to work day and night to develop a robot trader for yourself&hellip;</p>
            <p>And you probably don&rsquo;t have hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars to throw into one of these quant hedge funds (or the desire to pay their absurd fees).</p>
            <p>So you&rsquo;re up to the mercy of whatever these &ldquo;algos&rdquo; are doing to manipulate the market minute by minute. </p>
            <p>The other thing about these algorithms is that they &ldquo;hunt out&rdquo; sell stops and buy stops to make them &ldquo;mass trigger.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>An estimated 70% of all trading in equities is done by these robots. </p>
            <p>And about 80% of all trading is done using some kind of software.</p>
            <p>And, for the human trader, many will put resting limit orders, sell stops, or buy stops where they want to limit their risk on investments&hellip;</p>
            <p>These robots LOVE to hunt out stops (they sure did when I worked at Oppenheimer) and cause them to &ldquo;go off&rdquo; resulting in a wild market drops, followed by absurd market up-swings, sometimes in a matter of minutes or hours!</p>
            <p>Why do you think previously low-volatility &ldquo;safe&rdquo; ETFs like the S&amp;P 500 are experiencing larger and larger price swings?</p>
            <p>That&rsquo;s what happened in 2013 from a single fake Tweet&hellip;</p>
            <p>That&rsquo;s what happened on May 6th, 2010 when &ndash; in one hour &ndash; 1,000 points were lost and then recovered on the Down Jones.</p>
            <p>As Guy Do Blonay, fund manager at Jupiter Asset Management said in a CNBC interview, &ldquo;<strong>Eighty percent of daily volume in the US is done by machines, so what you get is a lack of focus on earnings, a lack of focus on
                    outlooks.&rdquo;</strong></p>
            <p>In other words, these machines don&rsquo;t take time to figure out what news or earnings or fundamentals actually MEAN.</p>
            <p>The react&hellip;and they react in nano-seconds&hellip;to scalp money out of the market. </p>

            <p><strong>The insane price-swings on ETFs are going to get worse and worse.</strong></p>
            <p>Over the next decade these computer programs are going to replace MOST people &ndash; all the big Wall Street funds and Institutional money in the market is going to be run by a few dweebs in an office and one &ldquo;face&rdquo;
                talking to the media.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, your &ldquo;safe&rdquo; investments are going to see insane 50% to 60% selloffs in a matter of one or two years&hellip;</p>
            <p>Paired with completely illogical &ldquo;run ups.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>The normal market cycles long-time investors could rely on, and the common-sense &ldquo;buy-and-hold&rdquo; strategy is simply no longer going to work.</p>
            <p>Remember the crazy price fluctuations we saw between 2000 and 2010?</p>

            <p>Be prepared to see swings as wild as those every decade.</p>
            <p><strong>But what if you could STEAL the same blackbox technology these Wall Street institutions use and benefit from it yourself?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Not only that, what if you could use these tools to make a fortune and never care about &ldquo;earnings&rdquo; or &ldquo;fundamentals&rdquo; or play any &ldquo;guessing games&rdquo; ever again?</strong></p>

            <p>As I mentioned before, my name is Andy Crowder and I started my career as a &ldquo;quant&rdquo; at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. right on Wall Street. </p>
            <p>That&rsquo;s where I learned the real, behind-the-scenes methods used by the biggest, most profitable Institutional players in the industry.</p>
            <p>I witnessed first-hand how these Wall Street quants programmed complex software systems to purposely seek out and SCREW OVER the &ldquo;retail&rdquo; trader (as they refer to individual investors). </p>
            <p>They&rsquo;d laugh at all those &ldquo;retail traders&rdquo; as they ran buy and sell stops left and right &ndash; taking profits off the back of panicking investors.</p>
            <p>They did this day in and day out. </p>
            <p>And listen &ndash; I LEARNED from these guys!</p>
            <p>I BECAME one of them&hellip;</p>
            <p>For example, I learned that while most investors rely on&hellip;</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>News events</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Analyst reports</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Bogus technical analysis (</strong>that&rsquo;s about as accurate as reading tea leaves)</li>
                <li><strong>Earnings announcements</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Fed announcements </strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The professional traders just don&rsquo;t care about any of that stuff. </p>
            <p>It doesn&rsquo;t even play a roll in the decisions they make.</p>
            <p>So while individual traders are doing the best they can with the tools and information they have, they will NEVER have the edge that these &ldquo;quants&rdquo; do.</p>
            <p>Well, something happened to me that doesn&rsquo;t happen for most of these Wall Street guys... </p>
            <p><strong>I grew a conscience. </strong></p>
            <p>I just couldn&rsquo;t sit around anymore watching hard-working people who simply want to grow their retirement accounts and create a sturdy, reliable next-egg get FLEECED out of their savings over and over again&hellip;</p>
            <p>Decades of wealth &ldquo;disappeared&rdquo; in an instant.</p>
            <p>I&rsquo;ve seen people who know there is money to be made in the markets (because they see OTHER people making money)&hellip;</p>
            <p>But they just can&rsquo;t seem to get consistent themselves and it&rsquo;s not their fault &ndash; it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re up against an army of cutting-edge computing power and lightning fast &ldquo;algo&rdquo; traders!</p>

            <p><strong>That&rsquo;s Why I Left Wall Street To Join <em>Wyatt Investment Research</em> and I TOOK this blackbox technology with me to share with the masses!</strong></p>
            <p>And believe me &ndash; nobody on Wall Street wants those &ldquo;retail traders&rdquo; to know about this technology, nonetheless have access to it or learn how to use it. </p>
            <p>But I don&rsquo;t care. </p>
            <p>I&rsquo;m going to show you exactly how this technology works (and why) then I&rsquo;m going to give it to you RISK FREE!</p>
            <p>But we do not have a lot of time &ndash; so I need to move forward. </p>
            <p>At any moment I&rsquo;ll start getting &ldquo;cease and desist&rdquo; letters and I want to get this to as many people as possible.</p>
            <p>Please keep reading&hellip;</p>

            <p class="h4 mt-5 mb-3 text-red text-center"><strong>So, What Exactly Is This Blackbox &ldquo;POP-P&rdquo; Indicator And How Do My Readers And I Use It To Take Trades With 90% Accuracy?</strong></p>

            <p>POP-P stands for &ldquo;Probability Of Profit Percentage&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
            <p>It&rsquo;s a quantitative formula known as the &ldquo;Black-Scholes Model&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s so effective, that the mathematical geniuses who came up with this formula received Nobel Prize in Economics. </p>
            <p>&ldquo;Quant&rdquo; traders use the POP-P to see the probability of a trade&rsquo;s success BEFORE they actually take the trade!</p>
            <p>Whereas most individual investors can only &ldquo;hope&rdquo; they&rsquo;re right after doing their &ldquo;due diligence&rdquo;</p>
            <p>The POP-P Indicator <strong>eliminates all guessing and works solely on pure, inarguable mathematical probability. </strong></p>
            <p>For example, on January 8th, 2018 I sent an alert out to my readers&hellip;</p>

            <figure class="float-lg-right mt-2 mx-auto ml-lg-5 mb-3" style="max-width: 350px;">
                <img class="img-fluid" alt="Alert"
                    src="assets/img/popp-v1/bb-alert-1.png">
            </figure>

            <p>I was alerted by the POP-P indicator to take a trade on SPY&hellip;</p>
            <p>Here&rsquo;s what I sent them:</p>
            <p>&ldquo;The Probability of profit &ndash; 72.46% -- the max return on the trade is 35.1%&rdquo;</p>
            <p><strong>That&rsquo;s enough to turn $5,000 into $6,755&hellip;</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Or $10,000 into $13,510&hellip;</strong></p>
            <p>Now, very quickly before I continue, you may be thinking&hellip;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;If this POP-P Indicator shows you the exact probability of profit, why not give yourself a 100% chance of winning the trade?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>The reason why is simple:</p>
            <p>The more probability is on your side for the trade, the less money you will make.</p>
            <p>As the saying goes, &ldquo;No risk, no reward.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>If you want to take a trade that has a 99.9% probability of working, you&rsquo;re going to make pennies.</p>
            <p>So I like to strike a balance of taking trades with between a 75% and 85% chance of working&hellip;</p>
            <p>It still puts probability in our favor, but also allows us to collect a handsome gain. </p>
            <p>Yet, as I illustrated earlier, <strong>we won almost 90% of all the trades taken in 2018.</strong></p>
            <p>The reason why is because we are able to easily spot if the trade is in jeopardy of failing (those few 15% to 25% chances it WON&rsquo;T work) and close out our trades early for a smaller gain. </p>
            <p>So maybe instead of making 40%...you make 10%.</p>
            <p>But who cares, right?</p>
            <p>Money is money&hellip;</p>
            <p><strong>We take these trades over and over again like clockwork &ndash; always knowing without a doubt the exact probability of success&hellip;</strong></p>
            <p>January 11th, 2018&hellip;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Probability of profit 74.24% &mdash; max return 24.5%&rdquo;</p>

            <p>These are just five trades out of nearly 70 trades, and just a few from the very beginning of 2018&hellip;.</p>
            <p>These are the exact same trades we used to <strong>turn $500 into $90,30.50!</strong></p>
            <p>Using this blackbox POP-P Indicator, I send these trade alerts out to my readers, because I simply do NOT believe the big Wall Street firms should be the only people with this power. </p>
            <p>Yet, here is the really amazing thing about these simple trades&hellip;</p>

            <p class="h4 mt-5 mb-3 text-red text-center">
                <strong>
                    The POP-P Indicator Allows You To Make<br class="d-none d-lg-block">
                    Money In ANY Market Environment
                </strong>
            </p>

            <p>For most buy-and-hold investors, they can only make money if the market goes one direction &ndash; UP. </p>
            <p>If you ask me, that&rsquo;s a lot like buying a car that can only drive forward. </p>
            <p>It can&rsquo;t reverse&hellip;it can&rsquo;t turn left or right&hellip;it can only just keep going straight (so you better hope the road doesn&rsquo;t curve). </p>
            <p><strong>But what if you could make money whether the market goes up&hellip;down&hellip;or sideways?</strong></p>
            <p>In fact, what if you could completely remove &ldquo;direction&rdquo; from the market overall?</p>
            <p>You see, with the POP-P Indicator we use OPTIONS &ndash; which means we aren&rsquo;t buying or shorting any actual shares of stock. </p>
            <p>In fact we aren&rsquo;t actually &ldquo;buying&rdquo; anything. </p>
            <p>We are SELLING!</p>
            <p>People use Options for all sorts of reasons &ndash;&nbsp; Mutual Funds or Hedge Funds for example may buy options occasionally to hedge a position&hellip;</p>
            <p>(Yet they make the most money by selling options &ndash; it&rsquo;s one of the favorite strategies giant Wall Street institutions use&hellip; I know because it was what I did for a LIVING at Oppenheimer).</p>
            <p>But, MOST of the time individual traders are buying Options to gamble and speculate with. </p>
            <p>For example, take Apple.</p>
            <p>If you want to take a trade directly on Apple it will cost you about $170 a share. </p>
            <p>So if you want to buy 100 shares of Apple it will cost you $17,000 and if the price goes to $175 you can sell your shares for $17,500, making a $500 profit.</p>
            <p>Or basically &ndash; 2.94%.</p>
            <p>Or, you could buy one Options Contract for $75 that represents 100 shares of Apple.</p>
            <p>And if the price goes up $5 you can make something like 30%....60%....300% even.</p>
            <p>Basically, you can &ldquo;rent&rdquo; the stock, benefit off its price movements, and get even bigger gains than if you were to buy shares outright.</p>
            <p>That sounds really attractive, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
            <p><strong>Until you realize that most options expire worthless (about 80% of them!)</strong></p>
            <p>You see, when someone buys an Option, the price of Apple has to move from $170 to $175 in a specific amount of time, or the option is worth nothing. </p>
            <p>So if Apple doesn&rsquo;t get to $175 within five days of you buying that option&hellip;you lose.</p>
            <p>So TIME is against you!</p>
            <p>Not only that, you can obviously only benefit if the price goes in a SINGLE direction (either up or down depending on where you&rsquo;re &ldquo;betting&rdquo; it goes). </p>
            <p><strong>Yet, this is nothing but a gamble. You are GAMBLING on the price going in a certain direction to a certain price in a certain time. </strong></p>

            <figure class="float-lg-right mt-2 mx-auto ml-lg-5 mb-3" style="max-width: 175px;">
                <img class="img-fluid" alt="Chart"
                    src="assets/img/popp-v1/chart-2.png">
            </figure>

            <p>And you know what? If you want to gamble&hellip;</p>
            <p>I&rsquo;ll sell you the chips.</p>
            <p>Now look at the small chart below. Do you see that green line?</p>
            <p>Let&rsquo;s say that green line is the $190 price on AAPL.</p>
            <p>Now, let&rsquo;s someone buys an Option on Monday because they&nbsp; believe (for whatever reason) that the price of AAPL will be above that $190 price by the end of the trading day on Friday.</p>
            <p><strong>Yet, using the POP-P Indicator, we know that there is an 87.63% probability the price will </strong><strong><em>NOT</em></strong><strong> move above that line by Friday!</strong></p>

            <figure class="float-lg-right mt-2 mx-auto ml-lg-5 mb-3" style="max-width: 175px;">
                <img class="img-fluid" alt="Chart"
                    src="assets/img/popp-v1/chart-3.png">
            </figure>

            <p>So we &ndash; the Casino &ndash; sell this gambler the chips they need to take their low-probability bet. </p>
            <p>And here&rsquo;s what ends up happening:</p>
            <p>The price doesn&rsquo;t go above that green line by Friday.</p>
            <p>The Option expires worthless (to the buyer).</p>
            <p><strong>And we keep the money they paid us for the gamble!</strong></p>
            <p>Another way to think about &ldquo;selling options&rdquo; is to imagine yourself as an Insurance Company.</p>

            <figure class="float-lg-right mx-auto ml-lg-5 mb-4" style="max-width: 160px;">
                <img class="img-fluid" alt=""
                    src="https://img.bfpublishing.com/marketing/2019/fmmt/bloodbath-promo/sp/charts/gains-list.png">
            </figure>

            <p>Because that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re doing &ndash; you&rsquo;re selling insurance.</p>
            <p>If 10 people come to you and say &ldquo;I want to buy fire insurance on my home while I&rsquo;m away on vacation for the next two months&hellip;just in case it burns down&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p>You know that the statistical likelihood of those homes burning down in that amount of time is very low (maybe ONE will, but most won&rsquo;t).</p>
            <p>So you take their money.</p>
            <p>They have peace of mind. You have easy money.</p>
            <p><strong>No matter what way you look at it &ndash; all the odds are in your favor. </strong></p>
            <p><strong>Again &ndash; just look at how often this works out&hellip;</strong></p>
            <p>Sure, sometimes the gambler hits a jackpot and we have to pay up&hellip;.</p>
            <p>Sometimes a house burns down and the insurance company has to cover it&hellip;</p>
            <p>Yet, by a pure probability standpoint, the YOU always have the advantage!</p>
            <p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I&rsquo;ll happily take $10 from 10 people, and pay back $50 to that one winner and pocket the rest. </p>

            <p class="h4 mt-5 mb-3 text-red text-center"><strong>The Odds Are ALWAYS In Your Favor!</strong></p>

            <p>There&rsquo;s one more important &ldquo;statistic&rdquo; that is in your favor with these trades.</p>
            <p>Consider the fact that the price of any stock or ETF can only move 1 of 3 possible directions. </p>
            <p>It can go UP&hellip;</p>
            <p>It can go DOWN&hellip;</p>
            <p>Or, it can go sideways&hellip; </p>
            <p>Like this:</p>

            <figure class="my-4 pb-3 mx-auto" style="max-width: 550px;">
                <img class="img-fluid" alt="Chart"
                    src="assets/img/popp-v1/chart-4.png">
            </figure>

            <p>For a normal &ldquo;directional trader&rdquo; you only make money if the market is going up (or down if you&rsquo;re brave enough to short it).</p>
            <p>If the market goes sideways, the only thing you can really hope for is to &ldquo;break even.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>But, when we sell an option, the price of the stock only needs to stay away from a certain point. </p>
            <p>And using the POP-P Indicator we know with 90% accuracy, the probability of the price of a stock reaching any given point. </p>
            <p>Look:</p>

            <figure class="my-4 pb-3 mx-auto" style="max-width: 550px;">
                <img class="img-fluid" alt="Chart"
                    src="assets/img/popp-v1/chart-5.png">
            </figure>

            <p>The POP-P Indicator tells us there is an 86.27% chance that the price will NOT reach either one of those purple lines. </p>
            <p>So the price can go up&hellip;.</p>
            <p>It can go down&hellip;</p>
            <p>It can go SIDEWAYS&hellip;</p>
            <p>And we profit anyway. </p>
            <p>The only thing the price CAN&rsquo;T do is go too far up (or two far down) in one direction. </p>
            <p>That means, in any given position, you are benefiting on 2 out of 3 potential price movements. </p>
            <p>That means, from a pure percentage basis (all other factors being taken out of the equation) that&rsquo;s 66.7% in your favor!</p>
            <p>And even if the price &ldquo;moves against us&rdquo; it&rsquo;s easy to close your position early at either just a smaller gain (or a very, very small loss).</p>
            <p><strong>So think about that for a moment:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>80% of all options expire worthless (good for the seller (you), bad for the buyer)</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>You benefit on 2 out of 3 possible price movements (good for the seller (you), bad for the buyer)</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Time is in your favor (not in the buyer&rsquo;s favor)</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>These factors ALONE are enough to make these types of trades a no-brainer&hellip;</p>
            <p>However&hellip;</p>

            <p class="h4 mt-5 mb-3 text-red text-center">

                </strong>
            </p>

            <p>Remember, the POP-P Indicator literally tells you the exact probability of a trade working out in your favor&hellip;</p>
            <p>And it uses a sophisticated quantitative formulation established by some of the smartest mathematicians and scientists in the world to do it&hellip;</p>

            <p>Just <strong>PURE PROBABILITY!</strong></p>
            <p>Why not use the SAME tool the largest money management institutions in the world use to rake in 10% to 30% gains week after week, month after month, year after year?</p>
            <p>For example, you could have woken up the morning of March 26th and received the following trade alert&hellip;</p>
            <p><strong>&ldquo;Probability of profit 82.7% &mdash; 42.9% max gain&rdquo;</strong></p>

            <p>My old colleagues back at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. are probably having a panic attack right now. </p>
            <p>The fact that I&rsquo;m spilling the behind-the-scenes secrets of their coveted POP-P indicator is enough to threaten their vice-grip monopoly on the market.</p>
            <p>But I don&rsquo;t care. I&rsquo;m letting the POP-P indicator &ldquo;out of the bag&rdquo; so the Wall Street elites can&rsquo;t corner the market while the &ldquo;little guy&rdquo; gets fleeced. </p>
            <p>In this report I&rsquo;ll show you exactly how to set the POP-P indicator up in your broker and how to instantly see the EXACT mathematical probability of a trade working out in your favor.</p>
            <p>BEFORE you even take the trade!</p>
            <p>This is what makes this closeted &ldquo;POP-P Indicator&rdquo; so coveted. </p>
            <p>It is favored by the smartest &ldquo;Quants&rdquo; on Wall Street (that is the &ldquo;Quantitative Traders&rdquo; the &ldquo;math geniuses&rdquo; hired by big Wall Street firms and paid millions a year to crunch data and make
                decisions based on hard statistics, rather than &ldquo;gut feelings&rdquo;). </p>
            <p>And now this invaluable tool will be YOURS.</p>
            <p>You&rsquo;ll never have to &ldquo;guess&rdquo; another trade again.</p>
            <p>Imagine that for a moment &ndash; before you even &ldquo;hit the button&rdquo; to take a trade, you&rsquo;ll know the exact probability of profit percentage.</p>

                </strong>
            </p>

            <p>All you need is a half-way decent Internet connection and you can take these trades from anywhere. </p>
            <p>In fact, most mainstream brokers now have mobile apps. </p>
            <p>You could easily take these trades on a phone or tablet over a cup of coffee in the morning. </p>
            <p>Imagine that for a moment&hellip;</p>

            <figure class="float-lg-right mx-auto ml-lg-5 mb-3" style="max-width: 350px;">
                <img class="img-fluid" alt=""

            </figure>

            <p>You can make tens of thousands of dollars a week FROM YOUR PHONE!</p>
            <p>For example, you could take an impromptu trip to the Maldives&hellip;.</p>
            <p>Once morning you&rsquo;re there, sipping on a coffee, staring out at the sapphire-blue ocean.</p>
            <p>Suddenly, your phone &ldquo;pings&rdquo; &ndash; it&rsquo;s a trade alert from me. </p>
            <p>You open your broker&rsquo;s app on your phone, enter the trade in between sips of fresh-squeezed orange juice, and by the time your plane touches the ground back home a week or two later?</p>

            <p>Well&hellip;that SINGLE trade could have paid for your ENTIRE vacation!</p>
            <p><strong>This could be your reality.</strong></p>
            <p>You could take these trades from Cancun&hellip;</p>
            <p>Or while warming by the fire at a ski lodge in Colorado&hellip;</p>
            <p>Or while just sitting with your family at the kitchen table and enjoying their company&hellip;</p>

            <p><strong>Now Listen&hellip;</strong></p>
            <p>I know that &ndash; probably your entire life &ndash; it has been <em>drilled</em> into your mind that &ldquo;easy money isn&rsquo;t possible&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
            <p>Or that &ldquo;the stock market is a gamble!&rdquo;</p>
            <p>And that the only way to make consistent income is through &ldquo;hard work&rdquo; and &ldquo;long-term savings over DECADES!&rdquo;</p>
            <p>But I want you to understand something. </p>
            <p>We live in a drastically different world from even just 15 years ago!</p>
            <p>Let me put it this way&hellip;</p>
            <p>These types of trades were not even POSSIBLE prior to October 2005!</p>
            <p>That&rsquo;s just 13 years!</p>
            <p>Remember, the first smart phone didn&rsquo;t come out until 2007&hellip;</p>
            <p>And it wasn&rsquo;t until 2010 that most people could even trade easily on their phone, tablet, or laptop&hellip;</p>
            <p>So, in reality, this method of trading has only been widely available for about 8 years!</p>
            <p>And still, barely anybody knows about it. </p>
            <p><strong>The rules have CHANGED. You CAN make &ldquo;easy money.&rdquo;</strong></p>
            <p>You can literally take five minutes to push a couple of buttons and generate hundreds&hellip;thousands&hellip;even tens of thousands of dollars. </p>
            <p>The guys on Wall Street do it EVERY DAY. </p>
            <p>They run billions of dollars like it&rsquo;s nothing. </p>
            <p>And guess what? They aren&rsquo;t smarter than you.</p>
            <p>One of the best-kept secrets about the institutional traders on Wall Street is that barely any of them have a formal finance background.</p>
            <p>Most of them just came on board and were trained on-site. They&rsquo;re not geniuses. They don&rsquo;t posses some super-human intellect or skills (most of them are pretty dumb). </p>
            <p>Why can&rsquo;t you do what they do?</p>
            <p>Well, today can be the start of a new way of life for you. </p>
            <p>I am going to hand you this Institutional trading method and Wall Street&rsquo;s coveted POP-P Indicator over to you on a silver platter.</p>
            <p>I&rsquo;m going to hand over the best-kept secret on Wall Street &ndash; a trading method that allows you to know with absolute CERTAINTY what the pure mathematical probability is of you winning a trade&hellip;</p>

            <p>I&rsquo;m excited for you, because it really is a stroke of luck that you found out about <strong><em>The Five Minute Millionaire Trader</em></strong> as well as <strong>The Pop-P Indicator</strong> when you did.</p>
            <p>Because right now I&rsquo;m running a special, limited-time promotional offer. </p>
            <p>Why?</p>
            <p>This trade alert service is BRAND NEW!</p>
            <p>I have higher=priced trade alert services that run between $2,000 and $5,000!</p>
            <p>But I wanted to create a lower-cost entry-level service for people who may not have that kind of money to work with right now (or who want to &ldquo;test out the trades&rdquo; before they commit to my higher-priced
                &ldquo;premium&rdquo; services). </p>
            <p>And I wanted to provide this lower-cost service while still allowing subscribers the ability to take trades that can make them hundreds&hellip;thousands&hellip;.even TENS of thousands of dollars a month like clockwork. </p>
            <p>So when I approached my publisher (Wyatt Investment Research) about my idea, we got into a lengthy discussion about price. </p>
            <p>We settled on $199 a year for this service &ndash; it&rsquo;s the lowest we could go without losing money&hellip;</p>
            <p>(After all, you simply cannot run a business providing cutting-edge investment analysis, research, and trade alerts without making a profit). </p>
            <p>However, I asked one more favor from our Founder, Ian Wyatt&hellip;</p>
            <p>I said, &ldquo;Can we lower the price to just $49.99 while we get the word out at the start?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>After a little nudging, he finally agreed.</p>
            <p>So right now &ndash; if you&rsquo;re seeing this page &ndash; you can get 100% full access to <strong><em>the Five-Minute Millionaire Trader </em></strong>along with all the special reports included in <strong>The POP-P Trading Method</strong>
                for 75% OFF the normal price&hellip;</p>
            <p>That means, for just $49.99 you can get 100% access, be one of the FIRST members of this brand-new, cutting-edge trade alert service&hellip;</p>
            <p>And get &ldquo;grandfathered in&rdquo; at that price, never having to pay the regular price of $199!</p>
            <p>But listen &ndash; I CAN&rsquo;T keep this promotion going long!</p>
            <p><strong>I Can Only Let The Next 100 People In AT This Special Introductory Price&hellip;</strong></p>

            <p>In other words, if you REALLY wanted to&hellip;</p>
            <p>You could take all my trades, get a hang of it, get rich&hellip;</p>
            <p>Then KEEP The POP-P Method and all the special instructional reports inside&hellip;</p>
            <p>KEEP using the POP-P indicator on your own&hellip;</p>
            <p>Get 100% of your money back&hellip;</p>
            <p>And then just keep making tens of thousands of dollars or more per year without me.</p>
            <p><strong>If you think about it like that &ndash; I&rsquo;m the one taking all the risk here. You are the winner in this scenario.</strong></p>
            <p>Yet, again, I&rsquo;m doing this because I believe you&rsquo;ll stick around once you get started with my research (like most of my subscribers do)&hellip;</p>

            <p><strong>P.S. </strong>There is no other trading method on Earth that is as safe, consistent, and profitable as the one I show you in The POP-P Trading method &ndash; period. No, it&rsquo;s not &ldquo;1,000% gains on the next penny
                stock&rdquo; but it is CONSISTENT 10% to 30% gains a week and that, alone, is enough to REPLACE your income or dramatically boost your savings account. </p>
            <p><strong>P.P.S. </strong>You truly have nothing to lose. Remember, you have 365 days to try this out. Most brokerage accounts have a &ldquo;Simulated Trading&rdquo; option. Which means, you can take these POP-P trades over the course
                of the next two&hellip;three&hellip;.five&hellip;seven months and see how they work without actually risking any of your capital. If you are not satisfied with how these trades are working (which is highly unlikely) just contact us
                and your money will be refunded within 5 to 7 business days. You have NOTHING to lose. </p>
